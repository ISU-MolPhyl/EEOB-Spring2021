TROUBLESHOOTING

 - in a cluster environment, you might need to load a corresponding module in order to 
   configure CMake and/or compiler and/or MPI library properly, e.g.

   module load cmake OpenMPI/2.1.2-GCC-6.4.0-2.28 

 - if CMake fails to find the correct C++ compiler, you can give it a hint with:

   CXX=mpicxx cmake ..
